# Project Euler
From https://projecteuler.net/
"Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems."

This repository is a collection of many of my own solutions to Project Euler problems. I've learned a lot from solving these problems, and I think you will too. While there are many code challenge websites out there in the wild, this one has a focus on algorithm design and is very heavy on math theory.

#### Note about my solutions
I decided to write these in Python solely for my own learning purposes. In general, Python may not deliver the fastest solutions, which is big for these problems (inferior algorithm solutions will run "forever" for many problems) in comparison to equivalent solutions in languages such as C++. All of these programs, however, meet the one minute time requirement of Project Euler solutions.
